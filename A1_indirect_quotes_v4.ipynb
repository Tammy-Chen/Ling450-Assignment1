    "\n",
    "#### File 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The couple claims they adopted from an orphanage in Nigeria and gained custody of in August.\n",
    "2) Kim and Clark Moran received a letter this week from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada informing them that the federal department has concerns about two-year-old Ayo, whom the couple claims they adopted from an orphanage in Nigeria and gained custody of in August.\n",
    "3) According to Kim, the Canadian high commission in Nigeria doesn't have an immigration office, so all adoptions out of that country have to be processed in Ghana.\n",
    "4) IRCC has told CTV that under ideal circumstances, the two-step adoption and immigration process can take between six and eight months, but that timeframe can be as long as two years depending on the child's country of origin and other factors.\n",
    "5) The Morans have 60 days to respond to the letter, and the IRCC stressed Friday that a final decision on Ayo's citizenship application has not yet been made.\n",
    "6) Kim said the family is working with an immigration lawyer as well as the adoption agency, whose name she would not reveal, as they weigh their options.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### File 2: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Wang told reporters she believes she has what it takes to take on Singh, because she has lived in the riding for 20 years and has strong connections in the community.\n",
    "2) Wang said her top three priorities would be improving housing affordability by increasing supply, creating more jobs and improving public transit.\n",
    "3) Singh has said he plans to focus on campaigning in the riding over the next month, so he can check \"elected\" off his to-do list for the critical campaign year ahead.\n",
    "4) Maxime Bernier's People's Party of Canada plans to name a candidate in the next two weeks, spokesman Martin Masse said.\n",
    "5) Ahead of the nomination vote Saturday, Eduljee told a crowd of about 100 party members gathered at a banquet hall in Burnaby that the \"whole country\" will be watching the vote in Burnaby South's byelection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### File 3:\n",
    "1) Witnesses heard him tell Kody that he now owed him $7, in the same way someone might exchange a favour for a cup of coffee.\n",
    "2) Golden said she looked for the co-worker who shared prescription drugs with Kody to share responsibility.\n",
    "3) The harsh truth, according to addiction experts, is an ill-equipped health-care system is partly to blame.\n",
    "4) Dr. Matthew Bowes, chief medical examiner of Nova Scotia, says he has seen that mixing benzodiazepines with opioids can increase the risk of death by intoxication.\n",
    "5) Tara Gomes, a co-author of the report, says there's a growing awareness of the risk of taking the two drugs together.\n",
    "6) Ernie LeBlanc, father of Jason LeBlanc, 42, says his son long battled addiction before his overdose death in a Cape Breton Correctional Facility cell.\n",
    "7) His father, Ernie LeBlanc, says his 42-year-old son suffered bouts of severe anxiety related to his long struggle with an opioid addiction that had started when he worked in the West. He was self-medicating with \"nerve pills\" bought off the street.\n",
    "8) Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia's chief medical officer of health, says it's been long known that benzodiazepines are being over-prescribed and overused. The drugs have a limited set of uses, he says, and are mostly meant to be taken only short term.\n",
    "9) He says in his area a police drug bust that temporarily chokes out the street supply of opioids will often be followed by a \"flood\" of people to local emergency rooms and doctors' offices, seeking something that will temper the misery of withdrawal.\n",
    "10) Too often, he says, they get it.\n",
    "11) Originally from Arichat, N.S., Martell says he \"fumbled into\" addictions medicine while beginning to set up a family practice in Lunenburg about 14 years ago.\n",
    "12) The CBC's Richard Cuthbertson tells us about a growing concern surrounding the role benzodiazepines play in the opioid crisis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### File 4: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Marc Garneau said in a statement late Friday that the order is a precaution until the cause of the derailment is determined.\n",
    "2) The Transportation Safety Board has said handbrakes were not applied.\n",
    "3) The white paper said cold increases air leakage from a train's air- brake system that results in varying air pressures between the head and tail end of a train.\n",
    "4) Trains are shortened when temperatures dip below -25 C to ensure pressure remains consistent throughout their entire length, the report said.\n",
    "5) A union representative has said the derailed train was shorter than the 135 cars CP has run in recent years.\n",
    "6) But a veteran Boston-based engineer said 112 cars is large for a train of full grain hoppers.\n",
    "7) Mulligan said it would have taken a lot of handbrakes to hold back a train so big.\n",
    "8) The Calgary-based railway said in the report that it also places locomotives at different points along a train in the winter.\n",
    "9) In extreme cold, dryers are used to prevent moisture from getting into the brakes, which means it takes longer to pressurize them and do the required safety checks, said the winter railroading report.\n",
    "10) The white paper also said train speeds must be reduced in frigid temperatures — by at least 16 km/h below -25 C and by at least 32 km/h at -35 C.\n",
    "11) Will Young, a locomotive mechanic based in Kansas City, Mo., and an organizer at Railroad Workers United, said cold weather takes a toll on many train components.\n",
    "12) Young said he suspects some sort of mechanical issue caused the braking system to lose power.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### File 5: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Justin Trudeau says he's not just concerned about possible cuts Premier Doug Ford could make to Ontario's education system as Canada's prime minister — he's also concerned as a father with children in the province's schools.\n",
    "2) The prime minister said he was \"deeply concerned\" about comments Ford made Wednesday, refusing to rule out cuts to all-day kindergarten and potentially growing class sizes in the province.\n",
    "3) Trudeau told the crowd that cuts to education won't help the economy grow or provide opportunity for Canadians.\n",
    "4) But the cuts would also hit home on a personal level, he added.\n",
    "5) Ford said Wednesday that he isn't guaranteeing that full-day kindergarten will continue beyond the next school year.\n",
    "6) It saves families thousands of dollars a year in child-care costs, but it costs the province $1.5-billion a year, at a time when the government is grappling with what it says is a $14.5 billion deficit. \n",
    "7) Trudeau's office said approximately 1,300 people attended the 90-minute event, which was the latest in a series of question-and-answer sessions held across the country.\n",
    "8) Trudeau was asked twice what the federal government is doing to protect the jobs of autoworkers in Oshawa after General Motors announced it was closing its assembly plant there at the end of the year.\n",
    "9) Trudeau said the news came as a \"shock and a disappointment,\" and the federal government will continue to fight for the jobs. "
